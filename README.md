This mod disables the spawning of unwanted mobs.

It can be configured using commands, 
f.e., 
```/wiis spawnrule<mob> reset/get/set<option><value>```,
it also has synchronization with the server and its own config.

I'm going to update this project from time to time,
so if you find a bug or want to suggest something,
then let me know (it is advisable to describe your message in detail)
